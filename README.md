ReactJS-toolbox
=====================

The minimal dev environment to enable live-editing React and react-toolbox components

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```


### Missing Features

This project is purposefully simple to show the minimal configuration for React Hot Loader. For a real project, you'll want to add a separate config for production with hot reloading disabled and minification enabled. You'll also want to add a router, styles and maybe combine dev server with an existing server. This is out of scope of this project, but you may want to look into [other starter kits](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/README.md#starter-kits).
